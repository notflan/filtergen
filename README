Automatically generate 4chanX MD5 filter entries for images based on 
Google reverse image search best guess keywords. Uses a slightly modified version of GISS (https://github.com/erodner/giss)

usage example:
	python filtergen.py --output dumbfrogs.txt bant "pepe frog kek"
	
	generates file "dumbfrogs.txt" with image MD5s matching `pepe', `frog' or `kek' on bant.
	Also cache non-offending image MD5s as comments so when the script is run again on this file
	it doesn't have to check the same thing twice

If you use this a bunch Google might start giving 503, in which case the script will fail until the block expires.
