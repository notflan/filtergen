Automatically generate 4chanX MD5 filter entries for images based on 
Google reverse image search best guess keywords and/or regex post matching. Uses a slightly modified version of GISS 
(https://github.com/erodner/giss)

usage example:
	python filtergen.py --output frogs.txt bant "pepe frog kek"
	
	generates file "frogs.txt" with image MD5s matching `pepe', `frog' or `kek' on bant.
	Also cache non-offending image MD5s as comments so when the script is run again on this file
	it doesn't have to check the same thing twice

If you use this a bunch Google might start giving 503, in which case the script will fail until the block expires.
If you complete the Capcha by manually performing a reverse image search, you can copy the cookie `GOOGLE_ABUSE_EXEMPTION' 
and use the `--abuse' flag. (I haven't tested this yet)
